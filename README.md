Distributed Wind Equity Rubric Tool
This repository contains the code and data processing scripts developed for the research article "Building a diverse and equitable distributed wind workforce: a strategic approach to collaborator selection" (Parker et al., 2025). The project introduces a replicable, equity-driven rubric and spatial analysis framework to identify and prioritize academic institutions for workforce development partnerships in the distributed wind (DW) energy sector.

What the Code Does
The code implements a scoring rubric that evaluates post-secondary institutions across the United States based on:

Institutional type (e.g., Minority-Serving Institutions, community colleges, technical/trade schools)
Geographic location (e.g., proximity to active DW installers, rural status, wind resource richness)
Socioeconomic and demographic indicators (e.g., minority population, income level, education attainment, unemployment, linguistic isolation)
These criteria are weighted to reflect equity priorities and are used to generate a composite score for each institution.

Key Features
GIS + RStudio Integration: Combines spatial data processing in ArcGIS Pro with data manipulation in R.
Equity-Driven Scoring: Applies procedural and recognition justice principles to prioritize underserved communities.
Replicable Framework: Designed to be reused or adapted for other clean energy workforce development initiatives.
Data Outputs: Generates a CSV/Excel dataset of 5,000+ institutions with equity scores ranging from 1 to 23.

Use Cases
Identifying high-potential academic partners for clean energy workforce programs
Supporting DOE and industry efforts to diversify the wind energy workforce
Informing policy and funding decisions for equitable energy transition initiatives
